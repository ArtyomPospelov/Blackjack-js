## Description
An elementary implementation of a well-known game in pure js+html+css with very minor differences from generally accepted rules. The features of these small differences are as follows:
1. There are no bets in the game. The game is played simply for points until the deck of cards runs out. The winner is the one who has more points at the end of the round;
2. The dealer always takes up to himself until he scores 17 points (or higher);
3. There are only two sides to the game: the Player and the dealer. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer;
4. Dealer's cards are always visible (there is no such feature as in most casinos when one of the two cards is hidden from the dealer when dealt);
## Technical features
All small animation effects are implemented via css. As such, there are no more "pleasant" animations (for example, smooth animation of the distribution of cards). Dialog box support is implemented for hints and various messages from the game.
All resources used in the game (fonts, icons) were downloaded from free sites. I made this project just to practice programming, so the code in it is far from professional. 
I did not use OOP in this project. The whole code is what is commonly called "structured programming"
## Super quick user guide
